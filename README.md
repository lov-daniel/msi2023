Solution
--
A web server was developed in order to remedy this issue. A combination of HTML and Javascript was used to create two separate UIs: 
- A panel that would allow the individuals to select a computer to reserve.
- An admin panel that would allow the user to make changes to the lay out of the grids used within the Triton Esports Center
